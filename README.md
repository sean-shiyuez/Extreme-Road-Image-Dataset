# Extreme-Road-Image-Dataset
This repository contains a dataset of road surface images, categorized into 6 distinct classes, intended for research and development in tire-road friction coefficient estimation. The dataset is associated with the research published in the following paper:

> S. Zhao, J. Zhang, Y. Jiang, C. He, and J. Han, "Tire-Road Friction Coefficients Adaptive Estimation through Image and Vehicle Dynamics Integration," *Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing*, vol. 224, p. 112039, 2025. DOI: [10.1016/j.ymssp.2024.112039](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2024.112039).

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following road surface categories:

1. **Ice Surface**
2. **Rough Ice Surface**
3. **Loose Snow Surface**
4. **Muddy Road After Snow**
5. **Waterlogged Pavement(Partly from online videos)**
6. **Semi-impregnated Asphalt Pavement**

Each folder contains high-resolution images of road surfaces, which can be directly used for training machine learning models or conducting image-based analysis.
